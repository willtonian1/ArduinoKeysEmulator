# ArduinoKeysEmulator
In order to make my own wheel, I have started to use the Arduino Leonardo and the Keyboard and joystick libraries to emulate a keyboard using buttons.
Currently using Trackmania Nations Forever to test button functionality.

## Languages 
Arduino using the Arduino IDE - Arduino is largely similar to C++ and uses similar syntax.
